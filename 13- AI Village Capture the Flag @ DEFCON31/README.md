## üìù **AI Village Capture the Flag @ DEFCON31**

- **Task**: Solve 27 machine learning security challenges, finding flags through AI security and adversarial learning techniques.

- **Rank**: 166th out of 1345 teams.

---

### **Techniques Used**:
1. **Adversarial Attacks**:
   - Crafting inputs to deceive classifiers (e.g., transforming images to evade detection).

2. **Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction**:
   - Using **t-SNE** and **UMAP** to visualize data and identify patterns in embeddings.

3. **Prompt Injection**:
   - Exploiting language models by manipulating prompts to bypass security filters.

4. **Reverse Engineering**:
   - Analyzing and reconstructing patterns or embeddings to infer hidden information.

5. **Image Manipulation**:
   - Modifying pixel values in images to uncover flags.

6. **Exploitation of Serialization (Pickle Hacking)**:
   - Attempting to exploit vulnerabilities in Python's `pickle` library for code execution.

7. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - Identifying hidden patterns and messages within datasets and model outputs.
